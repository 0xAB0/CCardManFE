## Requirements

- Node.js 10.13 or later (Check in terminal by running `node -v`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and `cd credit-card-insights`
2. Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`, and replace `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` value with actual backend API URL
4. Run `npm run build` in terminal to build this app
5. Run `npm run start` in terminal and when it is ready, open `localhost:3000` in browser

`node_modules` and `.next` folders can be removed to free some spaces in your disk. Just remember to redo step 2 and 4 before you start the app next time.
